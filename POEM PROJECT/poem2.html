        We aren't serious when we're seventeen. <br>
—One fine evening, to hell with beer and lemonade, <br>
Noisy cafés with their shining lamps! <br>
We walk under the green linden trees of the park <br><br>

The lindens smell good in the good June evenings!<br>
At times the air is so scented that we close our eyes.<br>
The wind laden with sounds—the town isn't far— <br>
Has the smell of grapevines and beer . . .<br><br>

—There you can see a very small patch <br>
Of dark blue, framed by a little branch, <br>
Pinned up by a naughty star, that melts <br>
In gentle quivers, small and very white . . . <br>

Night in June! Seventeen years old! —We are overcome by it all <br>
The sap is champagne and goes to our head . . . <br>
We talked a lot and feel a kiss on our lips <br>
Trembling there like a small insect . . . <br><br>

Our wild heart moves through novels like Robinson Crusoe, <br>
—When, in the light of a pale street lamp, <br>
A girl goes by attractive and charming <br>
Under the shadow of her father's terrible collar . . . <br><br>

And as she finds you incredibly naïve, <br>
While clicking her little boots, <br>
She turns abruptly and in a lively way . . . <br>
—Then cavatinas die on your lips . . . <br><br>

You are in love. Occupied until the month of August. <br>
You are in love. —Your sonnets make Her laugh. <br>
All your friends go off, you are ridiculous. <br>
—Then one evening the girl you worship deigned to write to you . . . ! <br><br>

—That evening, . . . —you return to the bright cafés, <br>
You ask for beer or lemonade . . . <br>
—We're not serious when we are seventeen <br>
And when we have green linden trees in the park.<br><br>
